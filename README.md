# d20-inventory-sheet-excel
A character inventory and encumbrance tracker for D20 games like D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder 1E, and others.

# Use
The sheet is pretty straightforward, enter the names of your equipment and enter a quantity and a weight in pounds (lbs.).

Don't forget to use the dropdown menu in Cell F3 to choose your character's Strength score.

The sheet will automatically total your carried gear's weight and your encumbrance bracket.

# Warning
There are some hidden fields in columns D, N, O, P, and Q. Don't delete them or you'll break the encumbrance logic.
